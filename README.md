# Just the Juice

A remake of an earlier project using the MERN stack. In order to get a better handle on using react, this was my first personal project utilizing the framework. 

Just the Juice is a sample project. It is a beverage recipe site that allows users to sign up, login, browse recipes submitted by other users and share/submit their own recipes. The layout was made using Bootstrap and custom CSS styles. Some other technologies used include react-router, basic ajax calls, axios, json web tokens, passport, etc. (see package.json for a full list).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
